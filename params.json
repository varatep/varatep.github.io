I partake in Agile Methodologies with a flat hierarchy where I am able to directly contact anyone related to our projects. Being at this company affords me many new learning opportunities and experiences with frameworks, languages, etc. I would only be interested another company if I were offered better wages, flexible hours with my school schedule, able to work mobile or on the road, and had multiple opportunities while working at the offering company to rise in payroll with the possibility of continuing as a full-time worker upon the expected graduation of AUG 2015.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
